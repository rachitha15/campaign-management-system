# Push Your Code to GitHub - Next Steps

## Option 1: Using Replit's Git Integration

1. **In your Replit project:**
   - Look for the Version Control panel (usually on the left sidebar)
   - Or click the three dots menu → "Version Control" or "Git"

2. **Connect your repository:**
   - Enter your GitHub repository URL when prompted
   - Format: `https://github.com/yourusername/campaign-management-system.git`
   - Authenticate with your GitHub credentials

3. **Push your code:**
   - Stage all files (select all changed files)
   - Write commit message: "Initial commit - Campaign Management System"
   - Click "Commit & Push"

## Option 2: Using Replit Shell Commands

If Git integration isn't working, use the Shell (bottom panel):

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add your repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/campaign-management-system.git

# Stage all files
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Initial commit - Campaign Management System"

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Option 3: Download and Upload Method

If the above methods don't work:

1. **Download your project:**
   - Three dots menu → "Download as zip"
   - Extract on your computer

2. **Upload to GitHub:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag all your project files
   - Commit changes

## What Happens Next

Once your code is on GitHub, you can:
1. Follow the `DEPLOYMENT.md` guide
2. Deploy to Render using your repository URL
3. Your app will be live!

## Verify Success

Check your GitHub repository to ensure these files are there:
- All your source code (`client/`, `server/`, `shared/`)
- `render.yaml` (deployment config)
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` (deployment guide)
- `package.json` and dependencies

Ready to deploy once your code is pushed!
